# PolitiCAUSE
An Annotation Scheme and Corpus for Causality in Political Text

PolitiCAUSE is a corpus of political texts annotated for causality.

We provide two types of information:

* (1) whether a sentence contains a causal relation or not

* (2) the spans of text that correspond to the cause and effect components of the causal relation.

We benchmarked the dataset using three transformer-based classification models, the models achieve a moderate performance on the dataset, with a MCC score of 0.62.

PolitiCAUSE is a valuable resource for studying causality in texts, especially in the domain of political discourse.
